            It is up to you if you want to use floats or flex to create a
            two-column layout. However, if you need support for IE10 and down,
            you should use float.

            T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3)
            is an important immune checkpoint molecule initially identified as a
            marker of IFN-γ–producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Since then, our
            understanding of its role in immune responses has significantly
            expanded. Here, we review emerging evidence demonstrating unexpected
            roles for TIM-3 as a key regulator of myeloid cell function, in
            addition to recent work establishing TIM-3 as a delineator of
            terminal T cell exhaustion, thereby positioning TIM-3 at the
            interface between fatigued immune responses and reinvigoration. We
            share our perspective on the antagonism between TIM-3 and T cell
            stemness, discussing both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic
            mechanisms underlying this relationship. Looking forward, we discuss
            approaches to decipher the underlying mechanisms by which TIM-3
            regulates stemness, which has remarkable potential for the treatment
            of cancer, autoimmunity, and autoinflammation.

            The STING pathway is activated in response to cytosolic DNA,
            resulting in the translocation of STING from the ER to the Golgi
            apparatus, where it stimulates an immune response. Luteijn et al.
            found that ACBD3, a Golgi-resident protein involved in the
            PI4KB-dependent generation of the phospholipid PI4P in the
            trans-Golgi network, was required for STING activation.
            Pharmacological manipulation to increase the abundance of PI4P in
            the trans-Golgi network resulted in increased STING activation.
            These findings suggest that therapeutically targeting PI4P signaling
            may modulate STING-dependent immune responses.
